Here is a repo devoted to classification experiments with class-imbalance data written with Pytorch.
Most of essential parameters are placed in `config.py`

You can learn about data preparation, 
model training and testing in separate notebooks.
However, it is recommended to use `model_training.py`, `models_test.py` separately or the whole process in `main.py` 
for training and testing.
You can also revise your trained models with interpretability methods during tests 
which was added here: Grad-CAM, LIME, RISE.
